# ${\color{lightblue} Dr. \space G. \space Vishwanathan \space Challenge}$

The **Dr. G. Vishwanathan Challenge** is a self-driven initiative to push the boundaries of problem-solving and coding skills by tackling some of the most challenging and popular interview questions across top tech companies. This journey is designed to foster consistent learning, enhance DSA proficiency, and build a strong foundation for cracking interviews at leading organizations.

### ${\color{lightblue} Amazon \space Interview \space Questions}$

As part of the Amazon Week in the challenge, the focus is on solving questions inspired by real Amazon interviews. These problems test a candidate's expertise in algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving strategies. Topics often include graphs, dynamic programming, trees, and matrices, which form the core of Amazon's problem-solving assessments. By solving these questions, we not only enhance technical skills but also gain insights into the kind of thinking Amazon values in its engineers.
